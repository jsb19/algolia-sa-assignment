*Question 1*: Hello,

I'm new to search engines, and there are a lot of concepts I'm not educated on. To make my onboarding smoother, it'd help if you could provide me with some definitions of the following concepts:

Records
Indexing
I'm also struggling with understanding what types of metrics would be useful to include in the "Custom Ranking."

Cheers, George

Hi George,

Sure thing! An index is simply a place where the data you upload is stored. It allows us to store multiple datasets and access them separately. Inside your index, you can have records. These are the individual JSON objects that make up your index. 

My recommendation for creating "Custom Ranking" is to use attribues that are relevant to your business and the data. For example, if we are developing an application for a social media platform, we may want to sort by "likes" and not only relevance.

Hope this helps. Let me know if you have additional questions and I'd be more than happy to answer them.

Thanks,
JJ


*Question 2*: Hello,

Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.

Regards, Matt

Hi Matt,

I am sorry to hear that.

Feedback is always welcomed and appreciated, so thank you for reaching out! Although I cannot guarantee anything, I will take this up internally and see what we can do.

Thanks,
JJ

*Question 3*: Hi,

I'm looking to integrate Algolia in my website. Will this be a lot of development work for me? What's the high level process look like?

Regards, Leo

Hi Leo,

There is no one answer here. The LOE depends on a multitude of factors such as the quality of the data we are uploading as well as the complexity of the application. Typically, our customers have a fully functional application up and running within 1-10 days.

At a high level, you will need to upload searchable data in JSON format to our servers. Once the data is uploaded, you can configure the search functionality within the dashboard. From there, you can quickly create a UI by leveraging our OOTB widgets/libraries.

I'd love to learn more about your use case so that we can strategize the best implementation for you. Can you send me your availability this week? 

Thanks,
JJ
